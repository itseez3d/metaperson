# Working with MetaPerson Creator

Integrating MetaPerson Creator into your UE project is pretty straightforward and follows the same pattern as integrations on other platforms. We've prepared the sample project that can help yout to get started. The project demonstrates how to display the MetaPerson Creator in your application, handle results, download, display on the scene and animate MetaPerson avatar. 

Download the [sample project](https://github.com/avatarsdk/metaperson-ue-sample), see the documentation and watch the video tutorial on our official [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/itSeez3D):
