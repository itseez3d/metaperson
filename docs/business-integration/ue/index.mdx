# Working with MetaPerson Creator

Integrating MetaPerson Creator into your UE project is pretty straightforward and follows the same pattern as integrations on other platforms. We've prepared a sample project that can help you to get started. The project demonstrates how to display the MetaPerson Creator in your application, handle results, download, display on the scene, and animate the MetaPerson avatar. 

Download the [sample project](https://github.com/avatarsdk/metaperson-ue-sample) from our [GitHub](https://github.com/avatarsdk) or use it's [marketplace version](marketplace_plugin). To get started with the sample, read the relevant part of the [documentation](overview#running-the-sample) and watch the video tutorial on our official [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/itSeez3D):
