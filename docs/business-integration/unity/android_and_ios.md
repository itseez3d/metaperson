# Integration into Android and iOS Unity applications

There are two mobile samples that are the parts of the MetaPerson Loader package.

1\. The first sample contains a WebView component to show MetaPerson Creator page and can be used out-of-the-box.

2\. The second sample depends on the [Vuplex WebView](https://developer.vuplex.com/webview/overview) component and requires this package to be imported into the project.
