# Integration into Android and iOS Unity applications

There are two mobile samples that are the parts of the MetaPerson Loader package.

1\. The first sample contains a WebView component to show MetaPerson Creator page and can be used out-of-the-box.

Watch the video tutorial for the first sample: &nbsp;

<div class="iframe-container">
<iframe width="560" height="315" allow="fullscreen"
src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P5GNQENZSvk?si=UWAUNtoMc2hlYo6N">
</iframe></div>

&nbsp;

2\. The second sample depends on the [Vuplex WebView](https://developer.vuplex.com/webview/overview) component and requires this package to be imported into the project.
