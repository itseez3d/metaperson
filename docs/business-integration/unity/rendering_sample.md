# MetaPerson Creator Unity Rendering Sample

If you're integrating avatars into a Unity project and aiming for the rendering quality seen in the [MetaPerson Creator Desktop](https://metaperson.avatarsdk.com) version, 
check out the [MetaPerson Unity Rendering Sample](https://github.com/avatarsdk/metaperson-unity-rendering-sample) on GitHub. 
This project includes several sample avatars and a viewer scene configured with the same rendering settings as the [MetaPerson Creator Desktop](https://metaperson.avatarsdk.com) version.
