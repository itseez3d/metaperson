### 3. What limitations do you have for integration MetaPerson Creator?

When integrating MetaPerson Creator into your website using an iframe, it's important to consider the iframe's size and aspect ratio.

If the iframe is too small, UI controls may overlap or become difficult to use. To avoid this, we recommend using a landscape-oriented iframe with an aspect ratio of 4:3 or 16:9 for the Desktop version and a portrait-oriented iframe for the Mobile one. This will give users enough space to interact with the creator without issues.

It's also important to note that the specific size and aspect ratio of the iframe will depend on your website's layout and design. So, be sure to test the integration thoroughly to ensure that it works well with your website and provides a seamless user experience.
